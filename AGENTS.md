# AGENTS.md

This document outlines task agents and planned work for the Tor client project. **These tasks should be used and updated as the project evolves.**

## Overview

The project maintains prioritized task definitions in the `/tasks` directory. Each task is comprehensive, including:

- Detailed problem analysis
- Proposed architecture/solutions
- Implementation steps
- Testing scenarios
- Effort estimates
- Risk assessments

**Important:** Tasks should be updated/deleted as implementation progresses.

## Integration with TODO.md

The main `TODO.md` file tracks quick goals and tasks that are not yet fully described. Sometimes a todo should be converted into a task, but sometimes it's simple enough to do directly. Use your judgement.
